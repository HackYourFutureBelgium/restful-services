An example api with (nearly) RESTful routes and data-centered services.

To study this code:
1. navigate to this directory in terminal
1. ```npm install```
1. ```nodemon dev-server.js```
1. Open [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
1. practice calling the API at ```localhost:3000```
    * can you find the two files where routes are defined?
    * can you find the two files where the data schemas are defined?
1. _challenge_: can you figure out how to use each service independently, by navigating into their folders from terminal?

We suggest using this code as a starting point for your own server in the ```../api-server``` directory.  Copy-pasting and modifying is a great way to start your own API, not at all cheating!

Some things to keep in mind when using this starter code:
* Most of the work can be done by changing the names of files and variables
* You'll have to make the most work in the ```controller.js``` files
* the schema in ```model.js``` and the ```/add``` method in the controller need to match
