# RESTful Services

Study code for learning [RESTful API's](https://restfulapi.net/). have at it!

This repository contains 3 directories, we recommend stuyding them in this order:
1. [./json-server-practice](./json-server-practice)
    * This folder is for you to get a feel for NoSQL, RESTful API's without getting lost in code.  There's nothing but a README and a .json file with simple data.
    * By using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) and studying the ```db.json``` file between API calls from [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), you can get a taste of working with RESTful NoSQL data bases before trying to write your own.
1. [./demo-api-server](./demo-api-server)
    * This folder contains a (nearly) RESTful API structured into two services, one for each data type.  Calling it from Postman should feel very familiar after studying the ```json-server-practice``` folder.
    * This folder has no documentation.  You'll have to study the source code to find out which routes exist and how to use them! How these routes are different from those in the ```json-server-practice``` folder?
1. [./api-server](./api-server)
    * An empty folder.  Your task is to build a RESTful API based on the code in ```./demo-api-server```, but using your own mongoose schemas.  Same structure different data.
    * Careful! the example code in ```./demo-api-server``` doesn't quite have RESTful routes. be sure that your API implements the routes [described here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
